=== CNet - Intel's Think Link is a Paradise for Fact Trolls ===

Josh Lowenson - April 30th, 2009

CNet had a look at Think Link and seemed to like it.

<blockquote>
What's really, really cool about this project is that as more people continue to use Think Link and create what Intel calls "snippets," it's building up the database of related dispute items.

=== ITManagement - Inside Intel's Top Secret Lab ===

Rob Enderle - Apr 8, 2009

For some reason he thought our lab was secret (most stuff is open source) and that we are in Oakland (actually Berkeley), but he seemed to like the project and led his article with it:

A great article about [[Confrontational Computing]], and [[Think Link]] in particular.

Great quote:

<blockquote>
This is, hands down, the most amazing idea I've ever heard of when it comes to using the web.

=== PC Magazine - Outside Intel Mad Scientists Hard at Work ===

Mark Hachman - April 2rd, 2009

This article about the <a href="http://berkeley.intel-research.net/">Intel Research Berkeley</a> Open House 2009 leads with a piece about [[Think Link]].

Nice opening:

<blockquote>
A popular Web comic portrays a stick figure feverishly typing at a keyboard. "Are you coming to bed?" he's asked, off-panel. "I can't," he replies. "Someone is wrong on the Internet!"

What if someone else could do that work for you? An Intel project that the company presented at its R&D day at U.C. Berkeley envisioned just that.
