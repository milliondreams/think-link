=== TG Daily - Confrontational Computing: Empowering all users via the Web ===

A great article about [[Confrontational Computing]], and [[Think Link]] in particular.

Great quote:

<blockquote>
This is, hands down, the most amazing idea I've ever heard of when it comes to using the web. It's a way to apply the full knowledge of the entire Internet viewing audience to everything that's published.

=== PC Magazine - Outside Intel Mad Scientists Hard at Work ===

This article about the <a href="http://berkeley.intel-research.net/">Intel Research Berkeley</a> Open House 2009 leads with a piece about [[Think Link]].

Nice opening:

<blockquote>
A popular Web comic portrays a stick figure feverishly typing at a keyboard. "Are you coming to bed?" he's asked, off-panel. "I can't," he replies. "Someone is wrong on the Internet!"

What if someone else could do that work for you? An Intel project that the company presented at its R&D day at U.C. Berkeley envisioned just that.
