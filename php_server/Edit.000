permalink tricks:
	Pull the RSS feed. 
	Find all "link"s in the feed.
	Look for permalinks that match these.
	
	But expensive to pull and parse in every case - as RSS can be big.

	Contains text "permanent link"
	
hack approaches:
	Just special case links that start with "permalink".	
	
Finding title links:
	Contains h. Inside h. Contains "title" in its class. Inside thing with title in its class. 
	
	
	
-- Finding titles --

	contains h?  - biggest repeated h title on the page.

Some blog pages have a permalink, but no title links.
	In such cases, one could get the title from the permalink, but that sucks.
	
Blog site often has an RSS feed, but that is typically just for the most recent stuff, and often wont cover the archive page that one is looking at now.


Permalinks usually fairly easy to find. Titles harder...

Some sites don't include the title of the blog post in the page title:



Blog post usually doesn't include any "h" tags except the title.
	Perhaps reliable to just pick the first "h" tag before the snippet.
	
	Titles are usually reliably identified by headers...

V1.
	Don't bother getting the title right if they didn't bookmark on the permalink page.
			We can do that later, and just give the source if necessary.
	Request snips for all permalinks.
	Encourage people to do snippet for permalink to get right title.
	
V2.
	Guess title based on nearest head element.
	Blog posts tend not to have head elements inside them. 
	Could be messed up by head elements elsewhere.
