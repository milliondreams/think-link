	Tell Dispute Finder about a claim on the web that you believe 
	is disputed.
	
	<p>
	To avoid creating duplicates, first search our database to check 
	it isn't already there.
	</p>
		
	<p>Try to use a minimal expression of the claim. For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>I dispute the claim that <q>global warming is a hoax</q></li>
		<li>I dispute the claim that <q>gun control would reduce crime</q></li>
		<li>I dispute the claim that <q>eskimos have many words for snow</q></li>
		<li>I dispute the claim that <q>margarine is healthier than butter</q></li>
		<li>I dispute the claim that <q>the world is running out of oil</q></li>
	</ul>	
	
	<p>Just because a claim is disputed does not mean that it is wrong. 
	It just means that there are other points of view that people might want to know about.</p>

	<p>Dispute Finder relies on users like you to tell it claims that are made on the web that they
	think are disputed.</p>
