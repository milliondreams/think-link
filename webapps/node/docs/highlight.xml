<h1>Highlighted Claims</h1>

<div class='docbody'>

Once you have installed the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11712">
Firefox Extension</a>, Dispute Finder will examine the pages you browse,
looking for sentences that imply <a href="../pages/claims.html">claims that other users have said are disputed</a>.

<p>If Dispute Finder finds a sentence that makes a disputed claim, it will highlight it on 
the page to let you know that there are other points of view that you might want to 
investigate.

</p>

<p>If a sentence is highlighted, it does not mean that the claim it is making is wrong. Dispute
Finder makes no attempt to determine if a claim is <em>true</em>, only if it is <em>disputed</em>. 
You should not interpret the number of sentences that are highlighted no a page as an indication of 
the accuracy of an article.
