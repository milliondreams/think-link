<h1>Disputed Claims</h2>
<div class='docbody'>

A disputed claim is a statement about the world that some people disagree with. For example:

<ul>
<li>Global warming is a hoax</li>
<li>Gun control would reduce crime</li>
<li>Eskimos have over 100 words for snow</li>
<li>Margarine is healthier than butter</li>
<li>The world is running out of oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Just because a claim is disputed does not mean that it is wrong. 
It just means that there are other points of view that people might want to know about.</p>
