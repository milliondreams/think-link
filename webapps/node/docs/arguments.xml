Dispute Finder considers a claim to be disputed if a trustworthy source argues
for an alternative point of view.

<h3>Viewing Arguments</h3>

<p>
If you click on a <a href="highlight.html">highlighted claim</a> on a web page
then Dispute Finder will display a popup dialog showing arguments for alternative
points of view that you might find convincing.</p>
	    <img src="../images/evidence_popup.png"/>

<p>
Of course, different people will disagree on which arguments are trustworthy or
convincing. When Dispute Finder shows you an argument, you can vote it up or 
down to let Dispute Finder know whether you think the argument is interesting.
</p>

<p>At present, Dispute Finder largely ignores these votes, but a future version
of Dispute Finder will use these votes to predict which arguments it should show
you in the future, and which claims have evidence that is most likely to convince you
they are disputed.</p>

<h3>Adding Arguments</h3>

All arguments are contributed by Dispute Finder users. If you have read an article
online that makes a good argument for or against a disputed claim then you can
add it to Dispute Finder.

<p>To add an argument to Dispute Finder, browse to the web page that contains the 
argument, select a representative paragraph of text to use as an excerpt, right click,
and select <q>Use as evidence</q> from the popup menu</p>
