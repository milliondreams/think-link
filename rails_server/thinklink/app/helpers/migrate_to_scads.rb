#TODO, normurl can be recomputed as a batch process occasionally, when our algorithm changes
#this should be derived data
#the only data we should add immediately is the data that came in -> the real url and the text
#want to keep the rule that all data access is through datastore, so we know what our entire model is

#for "realurl" should the "realness" be done on the server, or on the client?
#want to adopt the policy that only "real" data is stored directly. Derived data is computed using derived
#indexes - including normalized urls

#do we care what user created a point? Yes. Because they can delete it immediately if nobody else bookmarked it

#links should have creators and weights, just like any other object
#any object should have a rating, whether it is a link, an object, or a user
