The role of context.

What kind of claims are we trying to filter out?
	If it says "the team" should we take into account context when filtering?

What is considered bad?

What does it mean when we say we have filtered something out?
What are we actually looking for?


What we mean is that:
	* It is actually making a claim   - it is a statement
	* It can be interpreted as being about the wider world
		- e.g. not just "he didn't do it"
	
	E.g. if it says "the team" then we say it is bad.
	If it says "america" then it is good.
	A degree of personal judgement is required.

	Some of these claims would be ok if we knew context. E.g. we knew what "the team" or "he" meant.
	Most of them are well structured sentences.

	Would be nice to know how much stuff is thrown out by each rule...


Should we also edit another file to give that data?
	Where we remove badly formatted stuff, but keep stuff that does make a statement, even if ambiguous.	


CONTEXT:
	Should the filter function take into account context?
		Maybe it should...


Features:
	What works are present?
	What is the first word?
	What is the second word?
	What tags are present?
	How many of each tag is there?
	How many words is it?
		Is it below a particular number?
		Is it less than 10? Less than 4? etc
	How many characters is it?
	Does it have a comma?


Results from just using words:
	Accuracy is pretty poor: only 63%
	BUT: if we bring in POS tagging, then I suspect it will be better...
