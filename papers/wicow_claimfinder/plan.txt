Background:
	Information credibility is important
		We are increasingly reliant on information from the web
		People read a wider range of sources that before
		People do not trust information from the web
	People do not posses sufficient skills to know what information in credible
		Do not rigorously evaluate sources
	
Approaches to credibility:
	Focus on helping people know when particular information is disputed.
	Alternative is to focus on reputation of a person.
	Our aim is to let you know when someone credible disagrees with
		something you read.
		
What we have done:
	Built a database of disputed claims
	A disputed claim is a claim that someone thinks others are making and believes is wrong
	
How might people use this data:
	Auto-detect whether a document you are reading now contains disputed claims.
	Auto-detect whether a document you read previously is disputed.
	Tell me about disputed claims about a topic I'm interested in, so I know if I'm being duped.
	Tell me what new disputed claims have appeared, so I can get a feel of the dialog going on.
	Let me explore what is being disputed.
