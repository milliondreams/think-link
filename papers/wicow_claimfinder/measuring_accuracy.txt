Simple way to measure accuracy.

1.) Select a random subset of the dedup claims (e.g. 200)
2.) For each one, include whether our filter said it was good
3.) By hand, mark which ones we think are good.
	How? 
	By typing "y" or "n" into a spreadsheet.
	By manually deleting the bad ones (works in google docs)
	We then compare by seeing which good ones are left.


Do this for a random sample of the whole set.
Then do it again for 10 rules.

Need to make this really easy.


Store all data in google spreadsheet.


WEAKNESS: we don't give any stats about whether we trimmed the end off properly, just on whether it was a good claim.


-- dedup --

We need to pass through dedup before creating a file.
	But that is easy...



-- question --

Is the dedup pass actually applying to *ALL* claims, or just to the first line??
	Is this stuff actually working?

Ah yes. It doesn't use "<"


-- Do we care about doing all patterns? --

We only care about patterns that have more than 1000 matching for all years.
