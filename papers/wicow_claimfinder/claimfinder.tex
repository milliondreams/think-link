\title{What is disputed on the web?}

%%
%% Note on formatting authors at different institutions, as shown below:
%% Change width arg (currently 7cm) to parbox commands as needed to
%% accommodate widest lines, taking care not to overflow the 17.8cm line width.
%% Add or delete parboxes for additional authors at different institutions. 
%% If additional authors won't fit in one row, you can add a "\\"  at the
%% end of a parbox's closing "}" to have the next parbox start a new row.
%% Be sure NOT to put any blank lines between parbox commands!

\section{Introduction}

\x{Information credibility is important.}
\x{People are increasingly relying on the web for information.}
\x{People read a wider range of sources that before, many of which they do not know whether to trust.}

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{What is credible?}


\subsection{The distributional hypothesis}

\subsection{Contradiction Detection}

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}

\subsection{Crowdsourcing disputed claims}

\x{Dispute Finder. Wikipedia. WikiTrust}

\subsection{Curated Databases of Disputed Claims}

\x{Dispute Finder.}


\section{Finding Disputed Claims}

\subsection{Disputed Templates}

\x{Include a table with templates we use and templates we generated}

\subsection{Selecting Good Statements}

\subsection{Generating New Templates}

\x{Following the distributional hypothesis.}
\x{Search for known disputed claims and find most frequent words that surround them.}

\section{Using Disputed Claims}

\x{We are building lots of applications that will use this data set.}
\x{Dispute Finder highlights disputed claims on the web.}
\x{Tell people when audio they hear is disputed.}
\x{Tell people when a source you trust disagrees with others.}
\x{Tell me when a source I read in the past is now disputed.}
\x{Tell me how contentious a topic is.}
\x{Let me explore what is disputed about a particular topic.}
\x{Tell me when something new is disputed about a topic I care about.}
\x{Examine the zeitgeist of disputes.}
\x{Tell me about things that are disputed by the kind of sites I trust.}
\x{We also want to make this data set available to others.}

\section{Analysing the Data}

\subsection{Data Quality}

\x{Look at a random sample of the data and say how clean it is.}
\x{Evaluate the quality of the claims that we extracted.}
\x{Evaluate the quality of the clusters that we created.}
\x{Evaluate the quality of the different individual templates - which ones have the highest quality claims.}

\subsection{Trends over time}

\x{Look at what noun phrases were most disputed at particular years.}
\x{Look at what noun phrases were most disputed on particular days.}


\section{Conclusions}

\x{We can use the web as a corpus to determine what people think is disputed.}
