 <m:linebreak/>Use info such as font-size, position, and font weight.<m:linebreak/>

 <m:linebreak/>Baseline is using the text in the largest font size as the title. New method improves by 20-30%.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>Uses TREC Web Track data.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>Font size is the most important factor when looking for a title.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>-- TREC stats --<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>33.5% of documents have a bad title.<m:linebreak/>5.8% - no title<m:linebreak/>0.8% - "untitled" as the title<m:linebreak/>27.9% - duplicated title - one title for many pages<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>The big issue is pages that use a duplicated title.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>-- my simple approach --<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>Look at the official title of the page.<m:linebreak/>Factor out any text that is commonly repeated between web pages on the same site - the standard prefix/suffix.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>Thus:<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>* Gather a collection of title strings pulled from web pages.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>If the problem is "duplicated title" then just stripping bits of crap from the title string won't help. They already consider that to be a good title. They are attacking a harder problem.<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>BUT: A similar approach could be used.<m:linebreak/>Gather the following text:<m:linebreak/>   - title<m:linebreak/>   - biggest text<m:linebreak/>   - second biggest non-repeated text<m:linebreak/>
 <m:linebreak/>Look for duplicates in the corpus. Strip things out that are duplicated a lot.<m:linebreak/>
