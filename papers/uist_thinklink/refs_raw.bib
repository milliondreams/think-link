Got responses within minutes.
Many of the users seemed to be gaming the system. Only very weak correlation with expert responses.48% of all responses were semantically empty.   - copying and pasting. Entering useless data. etc
64 ratings took less than one minute - which is not possible.58% of ratings flagged as potentially invalid due to duration.
-- Experiment 2 --
Make doing the task badly as much work as gaming the system.
This made things a lot more effective.
Part of the task is verified, and this takes most of the effort.Important to design the task as a game at which users have to get things right to a certain extent in order to progress.
-- Turk Features --
Can exclude users from future tasks based on responses.Can have a screening pre-test.
Can use Turk as just a recruitment device, and use one's own software to get the actual input. But this requires more programming work.

 References lots of useful material from other fields.
 About rating a particular speaker, rather than the core idea. Rate them for validity, accuracy, reliabliity, comprehensiveness.

 asside:It's a shame that most academic publications are locked away so that you can't read them.

 Allow people to respond to criticisms of information quality in online political videos and their transcripts.
 Aimed at politically astute people such as bloggers.
 Rate accuracy, credibility, expertise, and trust.
 Could also apply same technique to a purely textual article.
 Interviewed three local political bloggers and surveyed 27 people. Did think-aloud walkthroughs with 2 local political bloggers.
 Supports both unconstrained comments and typed annotations.
 Doesn't seem to link stuff as part of a greater graph.
 Validity = well groundedness or logical correctness of a claim. Are they correctly interpreting their sources?
 High level annotations are "mark as a claim" and "add a comment".
 Can associate with an external source. Can rate trust and expertise of a source on a three point scale.
 Also allows user-defined tags.

  --    A tool for "social bookmarking, idea-linking, and argument visualization".   Says: "Students, researchers, and professional analysts lack effective tools to make personal and collective sense of problems while working in distributed teams".   "The intended users of such tools include members of the public engagedin a public consultations and societal debate [8], students or educators in a learning context [9], lawyers [10], and analysts in many other walks of professional life such as public policy [11] and scholarly publishing [12]"   -- cohere itself --   Start with relaxed constraints, but allow users to incrementally add structure.   Drop-down menu encourages people to reuse an existing idea rather than creating a new one  - we found a drop-down menu isn't enough. You need to let people explore to see what it is.   Can assign websites to ideas.  - but direction is opposite to think link.  - using web site as evidence, rather than as thing to highlight to draw people in. Ideas can play roles such as Question, Answer, Pro, Con.Use can define new ones - e.g. Datum, Claim, Warrant for Toulmin.
 Connection types have either positive, negative, or neutral polarity.Defaults include proves, is-consistent-with, challenges, refutes.
 Users are free to create their own connection language. Also entirely up to users to determine what positive and negative mean (e.g. could be inhibit in biology).
 Web feeds allow one to track changes to ones' own items (like Think Link). Ideas have their own URls - same in Think Link. - mention simple API.    -- related work --  "First, there are desktopapplications like Compendium [30] and Rationale [16] with high quality user interfaces refined through the feedback from their extensive user communities: however, these are limited to publishing read-only maps to the Web, either as JPEG images, or as interactive image maps."  Compendium and Rationale are limited to read-only on the web.   "CoPe_it! [18] is designed forcommunity deliberation, and provides a way to synchronise views between IBIS graphs (it also integrates with Compendium in this respect), an IBIS outline tree, and a conventional threaded discussion forum. CoPe_it! also provides a mechanism to evaluate the strength of a position, and so represents another interesting development. Its interaction design is at present rather rudimentary compared to Web 2.0 interfaces."  Parmenides enforces aparticular argument ontology (it was not designed as a social web application) and does not appear to support any other Web 2.0 characteristics.   ClaiMaker and ClaimSpotter were precursors to Cohere.  TruthMapping goes much further than this, aiming specifically at tackling some ofthe limitations of threaded discussion forums, with a clear distinction between unsupported premises, which when supported become claims, and a way to post rebuttals and responses to each of these [22]. DebateMapper uses a combined graphical and outline structure to map debates using the IBIS scheme, with contributions tagged as issues, positions and arguments [23]. The provision of mechanisms to enable flexible linking of web resources aroundwhat we are calling Ideas is a goal shared by the Topic Maps community [26], -- topic maps --
 Topics point to one or more resources (web sites) and can be linked by associations.-- me --   Think Link takes a less involved approach. You aren't trying to explore an issue you know is interesting - you want to find out when things you didn't know are contentious actually are.  Think Link is not a collaborative argumentation tool in a strict sense. The aim is to assemble the information you would want to see, rather than impose a rigid structure. Structure is only there to show you what info you might want to look at.   Focus is in finding things, rather than organizing them.    -- cites --   Compendium[30]. Rationale[16], Cope_it[18], DebatePedia[17]. Parmenides[19]. TruthMapping - url DebateMapper - url   AIF argument interchange format.   -- asside --
 could one implement think Link on top of Cohere. Maybe, but it isn't really designed for that.

 Integrates a number of known techniques:
 IBIS + articles + voting.
 Uses the IBIS formalism.
 -- 
 Effective deliberation requires that:*   All important issues are considered•  The broadest possible range of high-quality solution ideas are identified•  The strongest arguments for and against each idea are captured•  People can distinguish good from bad arguments•  Individual select solutions rationally, i.e. they consider all the important issues and ideas, and•  make selections that are consistent with the arguments they most trust*  The aggregate results fairly represent the “wisdom of the people”
 
 Break into sharing, funnelling, and argumentation.
 problems with just sharing: noise, unsystematic coverage, balkanization, dysfunctional argumentation, hidden consensus
 Funnelling: voting, prediction markets, etc. Combining opinions.
 Uses IBIS: because it is simple to use and has been applied successfully in hundreds of collective decision-making contexts.
 Includes articles in the argument map.  Disagree by writing a new article, rather than editing someone else's.?:   Debate continues by updating your own articles, rather than posting endless replies.
 
 -- IBIS --
 Nodes: Issues, Ideas, Pros, Cons.TL: Topic, Claim, links that are pro and con.  Topic can be a question.
 Has voting, version histories, search etc.

Program by demonstrating existing examples (web sites) rather than new examples.

They met with web developers each week for eight weeks, to get an idea of what they wanted.

 -- TREC stats --
 33.5% of documents have a bad title.5.8% - no title0.8% - "untitled" as the title27.9% - duplicated title - one title for many pages
 The big issue is pages that use a duplicated title.
 
 -- my simple approach --
 Look at the official title of the page.Factor out any text that is commonly repeated between web pages on the same site - the standard prefix/suffix.
 Thus:
 * Gather a collection of title strings pulled from web pages.
 If the problem is "duplicated title" then just stripping bits of crap from the title string won't help. They already consider that to be a good title. They are attacking a harder problem.
 
 BUT: A similar approach could be used.Gather the following text:   - title   - biggest text   - second biggest non-repeated text
 Look for duplicates in the corpus. Strip things out that are duplicated a lot.

 ---
 Part of Scholarly Ontologies project, which aims at buliding a network of interpretations enriching a corpus of scholarly papers. One does not have "right" and "wrong" values.
 Semantic web is about representing knowledge which is known to be true. Scholarly Ontologies is instead about knowledge which is open to debate.
 Scholarly documents are annotated or enriched with (possibly contradicting) interpretions made by readers.
 Annotations are expressed as triples/claims. [node,relation,node]
 Nodes can be chunks of text, or (typed) concepts.The relation is in an instance of a class defined in a formal ontology.
 
 The knowledge may not actually appear in the documents (unlike semantic web), and may be different for different annotators.
 
 Builds on "Scholarly Publishing and Argument in Hypertext"
 Shipman quote "Users are hesitant about formalization because of a fear of prematurely committing to a specific perspective on their tasks; this may be especially true in a collaborative setting where people must agree on an appropriate formalism"  [2] - Supporting Knowledge Base Evolution with Incremental Formalization
 Use a recommending approach, suggesting things one may wish to annotate. Searches for known noun groups.

 User enters informal annotation and system guides user to translate it into a formal structure.
 System creates plausible paraphrases within the ontology. User selects the one that is correct.
 If new terms appear, system suggests suitable enhancements to the ontology.
 System called ACE. Extension of the TRELLIS annotation tool.
 UI lists a number of suggested changes to the statement, which the user can turn on and off using check boxes.
 UI then suggests several formal statements it may be making.
 
 Can be used to annotate a document with the meanings of its text.
 --
 In our approach, users enter a short sentence in free text to describe all or part of a document, and the system presents a set of potential paraphrases of the sentence that are generated from valid expressions in the ontology, from which the user chooses the closest match.
 Handcrafted annotations can be more accurate and allow an author to express things the way the want to. However formal annotations let us do more powerful stuff.
 
 -- TRELLIS --
 Aids decision making process.
 A statement is a piece of free text or data that may or may not have been extracted from a document.
 Link statements together with constructions like "is supported by" or "in contrast with".
 ACE extends TRELLIS by helping users formalise their statements.
 
 -- techniques --
 * Suggest rewriting specific terms with their canonical values. E.g. replace "forwards" with "strikers".
 * Suggest simplifications, base on parsing.

Key insight is to work with DOM trees, rather than HTML.
Previous: webwiper, junkbusters  all use hard-coded rules






Finn[1] seems like it could be good. READTokenise page into words and tags. Then break page into three continuous regions - with content being in the middle.

 Create link model specific for a given domain - not one size fits all.
 --
 Most semantic-net based hypertext systems leave the linking consistency of the net to individual users. Users without guidance may accidentally introduce structural and relational inconsistencies in the semantic nets. The relational inconsistency hinders the creation of domain information models.Typed links a very old idea in hypertext, and standards exist for the web (though not widely used).
 
 Three types of hypertext structures:* unstructured - arbitrary node and link types* semistructured - recommended link types, but also use own* structured - fixed set of node and link types, and rules about what can link to what with what type
 
 
 Authors created the MUCH hypertext system (Man Using and Creating Hypertext).
 Found that users did not use link types - everyone used the default link type. When a non-default type was used, it was often inconsistent with uses by others.
 Uses a depth-first algorithm to generate hierachial views for printing purposes. KMS also does this.

 People assume there is one "optimal" solution and thus no need for a discourse.
 May not see the need for a question that is being answered.
 See decisions as being made based on power structures and don't see how argumentation will help them.
 Problem when only one camp uses IBIS and their opponents don't use it to debate with them.
 People do participate in IBIS but use social pressures to affect the outcome. Use IBIS in a destructive way.
 == Incorrect Expectations ==
 Important to describe what IBIS is not. People think the tool is intelligent and will solve the problems for them.
 See it as a retreival system - but instead just a place you can put data you find yourself.
 == Method related difficulties ==
 People had little difficulty understanding an argument that was already represented inside the system.
 Much harder to correctly add information to the system.
 Have to break arguments down into atoms and connect these atoms together correctl - which people find hard.
 A question may contain more than one underlying issue - what are you rebutting? How do you arganize?
 Connections between statements might make sense when created but not when looked at later as the context is lost. Outside of a train of thought, might not appreaciate why this implies that.
 People miss out important intermediate steps that make arguments hard to understand.

 Traditional hypertext resembles a directed graph.Their model uses Petri nets. Models a browsers browsing semantics.

 One problem with hypertext is disorientation.
 One problem is that hypertext author cannot formally express the order in which hypertext should be browsed.  (Web does this with layout - TRELLIS shows graph separately to document)
 "Browsing Semantics" means a specification of the order in which nodes should be visited.
 -- petri net --
 Net consists of places, transitions, and arcs.
 Transition is an event.
 Arcs go between places and events, never between places or between transitions.
 Execution is non-deterministic.

 -- Argumentative --
 Windows app for building argument maps.
 -- Cohere --
 Simon Buckingham Shum et al.Annotate a URL with ideas. Make connections between ideas.Links such as responds-to.Links to related URLS, but isn't about identifying repeated bad ideas.Has a firefox plugin.Uses various visualizations.
 Use websites to back up ideas, rather than connection going the other way.
 Plugin:  v1: just let you quickly mark up ideas you found on a page v2: also shows you ideas that others have marked
 Gets much closer to our work.Key difference: we focus on the pages. About showing you when stuff you read in contentious.
 http://technologies.kmi.open.ac.uk/cohere/2008/08/29/updates-to-cohere-browser-plugin/
 Toolbar shows a list of ideas marked on the page. But: this will include ideas that aren't contentious. Not done by highlighting. Different usage model.
 -- Compendium --
 Argument graphing tool. From Simon Buckingham Shum, Jeff Conklin, et al.
 -- CoPe it! --
 Another shared argument graph tool.
 -- DebateGraph --
 Web based argument visualization + collaborative wiki editing.
 Uses a nice argument visualization.The argument is shown as a single tree that can be expanded downwards.Further graph on the righ shows multiple parents for it.-- Debatewise --
 Debatewise is a not-for-profit debating wiki with ambitions to become the Wikipedia of debate.Anyone can start a debate on any subject they like and anyone can edit and strengthen that debate.    
 Simple site listing pro and con arguments for topics.
 -- The Deliberatorium/Collaboratorium --
 From MIT.Uses Argument Mapping to reduce "scattering" and "the soapbox problem". Break into refute, update, etc.
 -- IDeM --
 Idea Market.Information aggregation market environment.Little info available.
 -- Open Qabal --
 Blog engine and comment/collaboration system.
 -- Rationale --
 Visual framework to consider the pros and cons of an issue. Desktop app rather than web based. Fancy windows app.
 -- TopicSpaces --
 Java based subject map platform. Little info available.
 -- TruthMapping --
 Use nice revision system to update your rebuttals and keep things tidy. Add "critiques" to things, and update in light of stuff other people say. Pretty cool. Similar to delibatorium IIRC.
 -- Wordsmyth --
 Semantic relation thesaurus.
 -- Zotero --
 Reference organizer.
