=== Key Points ===


== Structure of the Web ==

The Web contains information of dubious reliability.

Clay Shirky "Not information overload, filter failure"


== Previous argumentation systems ==

We build on IBIS.

IBIS has known flaws, which we reduce.

We don't try to be strict.

Just want for/against/related

Lots of previous work about argumentation.


== UI ==

We highlight things in red if they are contentious.

Users can pick things out as contentious or interesting.

Contentious will be shown to others. Interesting only used as evidence.
	TODO: highlight interesting when follow link?
		- highlighting proxy?

Usage model where a user uses Google or whatever and finds web pages
	that make a claim they disagree with, and mark them up.

Can mark up claims in bulk using the bulk topic assignment interface.
	TODO: make this work well

Simple user study shows one can mark up instances of contentious snippets at very high speed.
	- show how many snippets one can find in an hour

=== Data ===

Seeded with all contentious claims from Snopes (6k-ish) and with a selected set of facts from FactCheck.



== System ==

Think Link can be included directly into a web site as a script.

Think Link has an Open API that can allow other web sites to include information from other web sites potentially with their own UI.


=== Approach ===

Discuss related work as I go, rather than at the end. 
Write as if I am a disinterested third party.
At least 40 recent paper citations. 
All web citations as footnotes.

=== Structure ===

-- Intro --

The Web contains information that may be wrong. 

Allow anyone to publish, means can't be sure accurate.

Quote from Tim Berners Lee.

Think Link is a tool that tries to pull information together. Show you when stuff you are reading conflicts with other stuff.


-- The User Experience --
