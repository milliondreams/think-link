-- key points --


-- Introduction --

* The internet exposes people to more information with unknown providence and bias
* But it also provides us with the tools to deal with the problem


-- Related Work --

* Argumentation tools allow people to structure an argument into a correct argument
* There are political hurdles with making such methods work : people don't always want to reach the most logical conclusion, or trust the method
* Our survey suggests that a trusted authority is more important than a good argument
* We experimented with including an argumentation graph, but our current version does not include one
