=== Abstract ===

Background to the area. Explanation of the problem. Summary of our solution. Summary of our results.

=== Interviews and Fieldwork Informing Design ===

What problems do people face?
What are people doing now?

Us:
	Organizing information they have found - use a Word document
	Finding bias - read multiple web sites. Don't know.
	Sharing information with others
	
=== Interaction Techniques ===

What it actually does, in terms of a new approach to interaction.
	In our case, it's not clear that our "interaction techniques" really are that new.
	What is new is the data we have and the way we use it.
		Perfect for CSCW and WWW, but not CHI.
	
Our new interaction techniques:
	Focussing on an idea and showing things around it.
	Highlighting information on pages you browse, to tell you what to pay attention to.	
	Lightbulb that slides out.
	Claims dynamically rearranging themselves around things.
		
		
=== Software Infrastructure ===

How it was built...


=== Preliminary User Feedback ===

	Areas for improvement
	
	Us:
		First study focussed on what people wanted. Looked at preliminary UI for looking at claims.
		Looked at people's ability to correctly categorise snippets etc.

A CHI paper should cover the entire iterative design cycle "observation, design, implementation, evaluation".
	We did the entire cycle - using the first study as observation to motivate second design.

--- what is wanted ---
http://www.chi2009.org/Authors/CallForPapers/SelectingAType.html

* Provide context about what is already done and what limitation exist
* Motivate that this is a real problem worth solving
* describe the artifact in sufficient detail for others to replicate it
* Is there a rigorous and convincing evaluation

Not quite as user study focussed.
