Says Zeno has support for "Multiparty, multigoal, descision making".
		- read ZENO paper more closely to see if that is the case...

EUCLID: Hypertext with argumentation
NLS system of Engelbert
ClaimMaker breaks "supports" down into 'proves, isEvidenceFor, agreesWith, isConsisentWith'.
		also has "addresses", "sharesIssueWith", "improvesOn".
			- e.g. "Global warming is a problem" is addressed by "cutting emmisions could reduce global warming"
		Current approach is that all non "supports/opposes" links are done by sharing a topic.
		E.g. "global warming" topic will contain both the above.
		Over time have been alternating between having an additional "relates" relationship, and believing
				that it's best to do this by sharing topics. This is an easily changed thing that we expect to
				evolve over time.

Typed links - present in Xanadu, Notecards, Hyperwriter, IBIS, etc
IBIS: We use essentially a simplified IBIS with only positions and no issues.

What are the link types?
	NoteCard allows the user to chose their set of link types.
			A model that we have experimented with.

	graph: support, source (we have both)
		
		
		
-- IBIS --

Original IBIS is very informal. ZENO formalizes it logically. Defines what argument, issue, etc are.

IBIS has topics.

IBIS has topics, positions, arguments, and issues.

arguments "support/oppose" a position.
positions "respond" to issues.

we conflate "topic" and "issue".
	e.g. "solutions to global warming", "who will win the world cup"
	

issues can be "successors of"


we conflate arguments and positions.






-- IBIS --

Questions, ideas, and arguments.

Hypertext environment for structured discussion of design ideas.

node types: issue, position, argument
link types: responds-to, questions, supports, objects-to, specializes, generalizes, refers-to, replaces.

We share the simple "supports/opposes" nodes.
We only have positions - not arguments or issues - but considering adding issues - as "questions".

Model similar to IBIS with issues removed.
