Push ahead. Going in a plausible direction.
Reasonable chance.

Big comments:

Study results:
	Biggest content problem.
	Not appropriate for chi.
	
	Don't want usability.
	Need generalizable lessons.
	
	Cut out anything that is not a generalizable lesson.
	
	No forward references to the study.
	
	
	Example of bad thing: didn't notice margin button, needs to be made bigger.
		No bug fixes and niggles.
		Could just say "saw problems and fixed them".
		Can give examples.
		
	Desire to organize into connected arguments.
		Info about what people are thinking.
		
	Table - lots of content that isn't text. Perhaps only interesting stuff...
	
	Talk to Ty
	
	INteresting things people did. Interesting ways people thing. Big ideas for major changes.
	
STructure:
	Introduction should be one page. (first page) One para on new idea.	
	Intro is just the front page.
	
System gets its own section.	

Extra into moves in with interaction techniques and gets called "The thinklink system"
	
	
	
Non standard format:
	
Standard format:
	
Put related work at the beginning. - after the intro.

	
Quantative numbers. Dicey to give numbers.
	Not really statistically significant.
	Numbers not meaningful for think-aloud.
	
	Focus on interesting quotes and observations.
		
When chosing between disc vs conclusions and future work, put it in the discussion section.
	People eval more heavily.
		
Have discussion rather than "limitations and future work".
	Place to discuss interesting issues.
	
		
		
"Pop out prism"	


People like related work at the beginning, unless you have to.
