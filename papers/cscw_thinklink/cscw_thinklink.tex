\begin{abstract}
Most mashups produced so far have concerned themselves with structured machine readable, generated from databases, or written in very standard formats. Addresses, phone numbers, products, personal profiles, information available through APIs, and information that can be scraped from well-understood web site templates.

However much of the most interesting information on the web is not in forms that a computer can easily understand. It may be in natural language text, or it may be in web site templates that our tool does not yet understand.

In this paper, we discuss the alternative approach of ``participatory mashups'' in which the users of the mashup also teach the mashup ways that it can understand new data. As examples, we present our work on Think Link, which connects factual statements on the web to related statements elsewhere, and Mash Maker, which attempts to understand the meaning of structured data on arbitrary web pages.

\section{Introduction}

If we understand what the information on a page means, then we can do useful things with it. We can connect the information to information elsewhere that might be relevant, we can compute new information from the information we have, and we can present users with new interfaces that are more powerful than that provided by any individual site.

Some kinds of information are easier to understand than others, and mashups have so far understandably focussed on the low-hanging fruit. Addresses follow an easily recognized pattern, and have led to a large number of useful mashups which plot various things on maps or work out what things are near to other things. Similarly, many mashups have made use of data that is available from APIs, or that can be easily scraped from web pages that have been generated from databases.

However much of the most interesting information on the web does not have a form that can be easily mashed up. 

Most mashups produced so far have concerned themselves with structured machine readable, generated from databases, or written in very standard formats. Addresses, phone numbers, products, personal profiles, and information laid out from standard templates. 

But a lot of the most interesting information on the web isn't like this. Much of the web consists of information written as unstructured natural language text. Arguments, ideas, opinions, factual claims, jokes. Information that cannot be easily be accessed using an API or a screen scraper.

We believe that people have the potential to benefit a lot by applying mashups to such data, understanding, connecting, and visualizing it in new ways. What other web sites oppose this opinion? What ideas would I need to understand in order to understand this idea? Do by friends agree with this? Is there a more respectable source that also voices this idea?

In this paper we discuss our work with Think Link, a tool that allows user to identify factual claims made in documents, and uses this to connect web pages to other web pages that make related claims.
